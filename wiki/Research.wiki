For triggering outside rules:
     "The *logto* option tells Snort to log all packets that trigger this rule to a special output log file."
     Could we then post process the files (zip/whatnot) and then run another instance of Snort on the logged pcap files to generate the alerts?
     Also, once an alert is triggered the *tag* keyword allows for traffic involved the src/dst host(s) to be flagged and further analyzed
    **If we have Snort configured to log to a database, then in order to 'trigger' an outside alert after post-processing all we have to do it log an alert to the appropriate database table, independent of Snort*. This should show up in BASE/whatever frontend tool we're using.

To the problem of multiple packets:
     The *Stream5* preprocessor should be able to reassemble some packet streams (based on a variety of criteria) into a single pseudo-stream we can test on, so the issue of splitting a document over several packets might not be a problem

In addition to the "content" keyword for packet inspection, "pcre" allows for perl compatible regular expressions in payload searches.

For the generation of the dynamic rules, section 2.9 of the guide describes now to configure Snort to allow the reloading of the config file instead of a complete restart- we could possibly have a specific file containing the IP rules where we trigger a Snort config reload through a command line command after modifying the rule file.
