#summary to do tasks

== Introduction ==

Various brainstormed tasks to start the project off.


== Initial Conceptual Tasks ==

  * Trigger external file processing from Snort (directly or with PCAP workaround)
    * Custom triggering alerts from outside of Snort
  * Look at packet captures for various methods and datatypes in exfiltration - how documents are broken up in packets
  * Dynamic rule generation
    * Rule chaining?
  * Keytext selection methods (histogram vs random?) depending on filetypes
    * The more unique words used the better a random sampling might be

== Initial Specific Tasks ==

  # Generate a Visio layout of the various components
  # Start conceptual design of post-processing component (Visio)
  # Start conceptual design of the keytext component (Visio?)
  # Decide what types/extensions of data we're going to focus on first
    * Possibly: Microsoft Office docs (.xls, .ppt, .doc, etc), PDF, plaintext?
  # Decide what language to build the keytext selection component in
  # Decide what language to build the post-processing component in

== Future Tasks ==

  * Design web frontend (PHP?)
  * Setup backend (MySQL)
  * Alert testing
