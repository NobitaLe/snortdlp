#summary To Do

== Introduction ==

Various brainstormed tasks to start the project off.


== Initial Tasks ==

  * Trigger external file processing from Snort (directly or with PCAP workaround)
    * Custom triggering alerts from outside of Snort
  * Look at packet captures for various methods and datatypes in exfiltration - how documents are broken up in packets
  * Dynamic rule generation
    * Rule chaining?
  * Keytext selection methods (histogram vs random?) depending on filetypes
    * The more unique words used the better a random sampling might be

== Future Tasks ==

  * Web frontend (probably PHP)
  * MySQL backend
  * Alert testing
